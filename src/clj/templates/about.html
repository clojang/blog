            <p>
              "Clojang" is a set of libraries and tools (including the library
              <code>clojang</code>-proper) that are dedicated to Clojure-BEAM
              interop, where BEAM languages include all those of the Erlang
              ecosystem: Erlang, LFE, Elixir, Joxa, Reia, Luerl, Erlog, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              In particular, the aim of Clojang is to support production
              deployments of distributed, fault-tolerant, soft real-time
              BEAM/JVM applications, capable of running JVM code in supervision
              trees with appropriate restart and fail-over strategies, hot
              code-loading (live system updates with no downtime), and the like.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the developer perspective, Clojang wants to make OTP-based
              communications between BEAM languages and the JVM as Clojure-idiomatic
              as possible and as natural to BEAM programmers as can reasonably
              be provided.
